## Pygame Game

In Level 1, players must complete a game coded in Pygame to progress further. Here's a screenshot of the game:

## Computer Vision Integration

One of the unique features of the Pygame game is the integration of computer vision technology. Players can use hand gestures to control the character's actions, such as jumping or performing special moves.

The game utilizes computer vision to detect and recognize specific hand gestures captured through the player's webcam. This innovative control mechanism adds an extra layer of immersion and interactivity to the gameplay experience.

To enable hand gesture recognition, the game leverages the mediapipe and opencv (computer vision library). The library processes the video feed from the player's webcam in real-time, identifying hand movements and translating them into corresponding actions within the game.

For example, when the player raises their hand and performs a swiping motion, the algorithm recognizes this gesture and triggers the character to jump. Similarly, other gestures can be mapped to different actions, allowing for a more natural and intuitive way of controlling the game.
